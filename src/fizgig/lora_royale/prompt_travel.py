"""Prompt-travel template dimensions for LoRA Royale.

Each dimension is an ordered list of words that reads as a smooth continuum
(dawn -> night, spring -> winter, child -> elderly). Prompt travel encodes the
base prompt at each waypoint and interpolates the *text embedding* between them
on a fixed seed, so the same subject morphs through the dimension.

The base prompt may contain a `{x}` slot where the waypoint word goes; if it has
no slot, the word is appended (", <word>").

# Ordered, continuum-friendly dimensions. Order matters — travel walks the list
# start -> end, so each neighbour should be a small conceptual step.

# ── Prompt-travel presets ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Derived from empirically-tuned winning runs (Kadu tests, 2026-06). Selecting a
# preset fills the whole Prompt-travel card; the `prompt` drops into the editable
# prompt box (the user tweaks the subject), and {x} is replaced per frame by the
# chosen dimension's waypoint words.
#
# Reference model: image 1 = the original/anchor reference, image 2 = the previous
# (sequential) frame. Two archetypes emerged:
#   • Identity-morph (Age): anchor ≈ 0.01 so the face is free to change.
#   • Hold-the-person (Era / world / lighting / style): anchor 1.0 locks identity
#     while the world changes around them.
#   • Face-but-keep-identity (Expression / Mood): a middling anchor lets the face
#     move without losing the person.
# Common winners across all: sequential ref ON, prev (image 2) 0.01, static seed +
# Seed drift 1.0, Slerp interpolation. The two PROVEN configs (Age, Era) keep their
# exact tested prompts; the rest mirror that pattern with a guessed anchor.
